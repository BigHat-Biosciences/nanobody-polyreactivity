The version you can access online is deployed on AWS.

To deploy a version locally:
1. Clone this repository
2. From the root directory (i.e. where this README lives) run `docker-compose up -d`
3. After a few minutes, the React app will be running at `localhost:3000`!

You can also check `docker-compose logs -f` to see when the server has started up.

To see the API, you can go to `localhost:8080`.
This will be visible almost immediately after you run `docker-compose up -d`.
